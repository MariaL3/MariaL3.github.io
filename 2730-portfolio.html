	My name is Maria Larracuente and I am a 2nd year student at Northeastern University. I am studying psychology and criminal justice and plan to attend law school. In July I am about to go on my first co-op (internship) at the US Attorneys Office in New York. I am super excited for this opporunity and I think it will give me great insight into the federal legal system. I plan to practice child advocacy law in the future. Now a few fun facts about me. I have been coaching gymnastics for the past 3 years and before that I did gymnastics for 10 years. This sport is always somehting I will hold dear to my heart. I love the excitment when a student gets a new skill and how I have been able to watch students grow and succeed for the past few years. I also love the beach! Whenever I plan a vacation, I always try to go to the beach as I love the ocean. This past spring break, I went to Hawaii for the first time and it was an amazing experience. I absolutely love traveling and being able to explore new places. For the month of may I am taking a trip to Norway to work on a farm and I cannot wait to see their culture and I know it is going to be a great experince!
