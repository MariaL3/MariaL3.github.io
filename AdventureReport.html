    <p> Adventure Report: Night Trip to NYC </p> 
    <p> Me and my two hometown friends (Lexi and Quinn) were driving around Connecticut during our breaks. Despite being at 3 different schools in 3 different states, fate had made our breaks line up perfectly. We had gotten dinner at our favorite poke restaurant and were planning what to do next. Then one of my friends said what if we drove to NYC, got some ice cream, and then walked around. We had been to NY many times, but these trips were always planned and we would normally leave before 8:30 pm. My initial response was no, there was no reason for us to go all the way to NYC to get ice cream, especially this late at night, it was simply impractical. Lexi looked at me from the passenger seat with big pleading eyes, and Quinn looked at me from the back with her best puppy dog face. I sighed and thought about it some more before giving them a head nod and a smile. I realized that a nighttime NYC could be fun, and at the very least it would be an adventure.</p> 
 	<p> I start the hour and 20-minute drive to Van Leeuwen ice cream. We start blasting our favorite songs and we are all smiling and laughing together. We use to drive together all the time in high school, so these moments are always some of my favorites. Once we enter NYC we look at the light-up sky in the city that never sleeps. No matter how many times I go to NY, I am always mesmerized by all the buildings. Before we know it we are already at Van Leeuwen. </p>
<p>Before we can go into Van Leeuwen, I am faced with a big challenge, parallel parking. I drive around the block to see if there is any easily accessible parking, where I would not have to parallel park. Despite my efforts, there was nothing, so my stomach drops and my heart begins to race. I take a deep breath and reassure myself I can do this, I have done it before I can do it again. Lexi and Quinn are shouting unhelpful comments at me as if they have any clue how to parallel park either. I slowly turn the wheel and reverse the car as I tell myself step one is done. I then turn the wheel the other way and straighten it out. I was not very close to the curb, but it would do. I exhale all the air in my lungs and smile. 
As we walk into the ice cream place, Lexi taps my shoulder and tells me she no longer wants ice cream. I laugh audibly and continue walking. She taps me again and gives me big eyes as she repeats what she just said. I respond with a short “are you kidding me”. She gives me an innocent smile which I ignore and continues walking up to the front to order. Quinn just ordered her ice cream and I then ordered mine. I look to Lexi and ask “are you gonna order anything” to which she replies “Im really in the mood for pizza”. I scoffed and couldn't help but laugh. I look at her and shake my head with a smile as I say “unbelievable”.</p>
<p> We leave the ice cream place and start looking for a pizza place nearby. The cool air brushes against my face and my head is flooded with the sounds of Lexi and Quin arguing, people walking by, and loud cars. I tune everything out as I inhale and exhale deeply with a smile on my face and I think to myself how thankful I am for my friends. I tune back in as I hear Lexi exclaim “Found one!” We go into the pizza place and my mouth starts to water with the smell of freshly baked pizza. I was full from dinner and ice cream, but couldn't deny a bite of authentic NY-style pizza. I steal a bite from Lexi and the flavor is amazing as always. We walk around for a bit appreciating the city and all it has to offer. I could stand there all night and be at peace. Lexi and Quin eventually get tired of walking, so we head back to the car. 
We get in and once again begin playing our favorite songs and singing along to them. We are all laughing, singing, and smiling. I was so glad that we decided to go to NYC this random Wednesday night. I knew at that moment this would always be one of my favorite memories with them and one of my best adventures.</p>
