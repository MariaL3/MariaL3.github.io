    <p> Review on Chat GPT </p> 
    <p> What makes a good writing tool? </p> 
    <p class="indent"> The most important criteria for a writing tool that students decide to use is that it's free, easy to use, and easily transferable. Students, especially college students, are looking for the cheapest options that still produce quality work and allow them to create the work in the way they desire. Being free is a key aspect of a writing tool if it costs money students are significantly less likely to use it. The writing tool itself needs to be easy to use and manipulate. Students shouldn’t have to spend time figuring out how to use the tool, it should be straightforward so they can get right into their work. </p>
    <p>WordHippo?</p>
            <p> WordHippo is a free, easy-to-use, digital thesaurus that has you type in a word and give the website specific instructions such as “another word for, opposite of, rhymes with” and many more. It allows writers to expand their vocabulary and enhance their writing as they write something. It also provides definitions and gives various contexts for the definition, as words often have various interpretations. Based on the definition that you choose to fit your writing, you then can pick a synonym that best fits what you saying. WordHippo also pronounces the word, so if you want to use a new word you have never heard of before you can learn its definition and know how to pronounce it before putting it in your writing. It also provides examples of the word in various contexts of different sentences, so you can truly get an understanding. In addition to its thesaurus functions, WordHippo can translate words from one language to another. This is an incredibly unique feature for a thesaurus and can be very useful for students who have classes in another language, or for students who are learning a new language and cannot remember a word in a different language. This tool is best used during the actual writing process itself. If a student is noticing they are continuously using the same word, can’t think of the right word for their paper, or are just looking to expand their current vocabulary, they can use WordHippo. </p>
    <p> My Experience trying WordHippo</p>
        <p> I used WordHippo to help me write an application for a scholarship. I wanted my essay to be persuasive and WordHippo allowed me to expand my vocabulary and choose words that made my essay stronger. I started out writing on google docs as I normally do. After writing a few sentences I noticed I already used the word invaluable twice and decided that I needed another word that could replace invaluably. This is when I opened up WordHippo. All I had to do was select the option “another word for” and I typed in invaluable. Within seconds I have so many options to choose from. I ended up choosing integral and converted my sentence in my essay to say this experience is an integral part of my education, and that I why I need this scholarship. I also used WordHippo to find a stronger word firsthand to include in my paper. Once again it was easy to use as I typed in firsthand and was then given a whole bunch of options to use instead. </p>
    <p> Why use WordHippo?</p>
            <p>Now you may be wondering why to choose WordHippo over other thesaurus websites, such as the very commonly used thesaurus.com. Prior to trying WordHippo, I never say anything wrong with thesaurus.com. It would provide what I was looking for and it was generally easy to use. Now after trying WordHippo, there is a clear distinction between the two, and WordHippo is definitely better. Thesaurus’s options for you to choose from are extremely limited compared to WordHippo, and they only provide synonyms under one interpretation of the definition. WordHippo allows you to pick from the selection of words that best fits what you are trying to say in your own writing. The thesaurus also only provides synonyms, antonyms, and a very brief definition. Wordhippo allows you to look for all of these plus words that rhyme with your selected word, examples of the word in sentences, translate words to different languages, and so much more. WordHippo is a much more in-depth platform that is just overall more effective. I strongly recommend the use of WordHippo next time you find yourself looking for a different word, wanting to expand your vocabulary or even to find the word in another language. It is the perfect writing tool for students to enhance their writing!</p>
