    <p><span class="bolded">Developmental Crime Prevention</span></p>
    <p><span class="bolded">What is Developmental Crime Prevention?</span></p>
    <p class="indent">Developmental crime prevention is designed to prevent the development of criminal potential in individuals, especially those who are at an elevated risk to engage in such activity (Farrington, 2013).  Developmental crime prevention is seeking to intervene prior to any criminal activity actually occurring, and focuses on guiding these individuals on a good track so that they will not later find themselves in a criminal situation. The driving theoretical perspective behind developmental crime prevention is the idea that “criminal offending that occurs in adolescence and adulthood is influenced by behavioral and attitudinal patterns that have been learned during an individual’s development” (Welsh, B.C., Farrington, D.P. 2014, p. 8). This theory explains the impact that childhood has on an individual and its potential effects on an individual. Risk factors are factors that increase the probability of an individual offending and there are three main categories for risk factors. These categories include risk factors at an individual level, a family level, and an environmental level (Welsh, B.C., Farrington, D.P. (2014). Developmental crime prevention is intervening early in a child's life to guide them in the right direction so that as they get older they are less likely to get involved in criminal activity. Developmental crime prevention has three main prevention methods, and these include the self-control theory, the multiple pathways model, and the cumulative effect model. The cumulative effect model has been deemed the most effective in preventing criminal behavior. It focuses on preschool programs, advanced early childhood programs, and early parent training (Welsh et al. 2018). The self-control theory, which focuses on teaching youth at a young age how to control their impulses, has also seen some success when studied (Welsh et al. 2018). The multiple pathways model is a combined approach targeting various risk factors in differing situations. Early educational programs under the cumulative effect model have been especially effective in reducing juvenile delinquency, an ongoing issue in today's society. Early education programs are able to intervene and guide children who may be going down a path that can lead to potential criminal behavior, and change that direction. Although juvenile crime has decreased significantly from 2010 to 2019 and is continuing to decrease, there were still an estimated 696,620 juvenile arrests made in 2019 (Estimated number of juvenile arrests, 2019, 2020). This progress is slow and steady, but more can be done to help these juveniles stay on the right path and live a more successful life. The most common crimes juveniles get arrested for are simple assault and property crimes including burglary, larceny, theft, and arson (Estimated number of juvenile arrests, 2019, 2020). Many of the youth who get involved in criminal activity do so because of internal and external factors that have influenced them in their lives, especially in the most critical stages of their development. Some external factors consist of neglect, abuse, and violence within the community (Baetz et al. 2021). These factors have been studied and there has been a demonstrated correlation between these factors occurring during a youth's childhood and their later involvement in criminal activity (Baetz et al. 2021). Yet there are also internal factors that play a role in juvenile delinquency and the most prominent is under the category of disruptive behavior demonstrated at a young age (de Vries, S. L. A., et al. 2018). If an element, such as a school, were to intervene there is a strong likelihood that the child's life can be restructured and not end up falling down a criminal path (de Vries, S. L. A., et al. 2018). This is why the effective use of developmental crime prevention programs is so important and can make a difference in so many of these juveniles' lives. </p>
    <p><span class="bolded">Effective Developmental Crime Programs </span></p>
    <p class="indent">Early education programs are one of the most effective developmental crime prevention programs. These programs are based on the cumulative effect model but contain elements of the self-control theory. They are able to target a variety of risk factors by increasing the chances of a successful future with improved social and emotional skills and reducing behavioral issues (Piquero et al., 2016). Schools have such an impactful role in preventing potential criminal behavior, especially intervening at a young age, as schools are where children spend a majority of their time. Therefore, the implementation of an intervention that occurs at school, especially within early education, will provide direction to not only academic success but also the reduction of antisocial and potentially criminal behavior (Hayden, C., et al. 2007). Early education programs have been proven effective to reduce delinquency in juveniles as these programs will demonstrate.One incredibly successful early education program was the Perry Preschool Program. This program took place in Ypsilanti, Michigan from 1962 to 1967. The program consisted of 123 disadvantaged students from the ages of 3-4 years old. The kids they selected were all African American, with a low socioeconomic status, and poor IQ scores (Program profile: Perry preschool project. 2011). The children were almost evenly split between female and males, with slightly more male participants making up 58% of the total participants (Program profile: Perry preschool project. 2011). This was implemented as a longitudinal randomized control experiment. It provided these disadvantaged children with a high-quality education targeting the children's intellectual, social, and physical development (Program profile: Perry preschool project. 2011). It aimed to break the cycle of poverty by combatting poor education, which is a path that leads to potential crime involvement (Program profile: Perry preschool project. 2011). The program also sought to improve the child's future success in terms of financial stability and employment. The program was a multimodal approach as it not only intervened in the classroom, but there was an implementation of weekly home visits with the child's parents. At school, the children were provided with a high-quality education by professional teachers. These teachers followed the Plan-Do-Review method. This method was a cognitive orientation that consisted of the teachers planning what they would do with the children, learning what was planned, and then reviewing. This was done each day over a 2 ½ hour period for a 30-week school year. Teachers planned their lessons over key experiences which they determined to be creative representation, language and literacy, social relations and personal initiative, movement and music, classification, seriation and number, space, and time (Program profile: Perry preschool project. 2011). The other aspect of the intervention consisted of home visits once a week for a 1 ½  hour check-in with the child's parents. Here, the parents were encouraged to get involved in their child's education and support their child in these formative years. Parents were also offered resources and support as they needed in order to best support their child. The Perry Preschool program was deemed incredibly effective in its direct benefits which included a reduction in crime and juvenile delinquency as well as many spin-off benefits (Program profile: Perry preschool project. 2011). Researchers collected data from the participants from the time the entered the program until they reached the age 15. Then follow-ups data was collected from these individuals at ages 15, 19, 27, 40, and most recently 50. The most recent follow-up results showed that there was a drastic difference between the control group and the treated group in terms of lifetime convictions, misdemeanors, violent convictions, cumulative earnings, drug and alcohol abuse, arrests, and completion of high school (Program profile: Perry preschool project. 2011). At age 19, only 31% of those who participated in the program had ever been arrested, in comparison to the control group in which 51% had been arrested (Parks, 2000). This demonstrates how effective the program was in relation to delinquent behavior. The data collected from the age 27 follow up presented that only 7% of those who received the intervention became chronic offenders (which means having been arrested 5 or more times) in contrast with the 35% that became chronic offenders in the control group (Parks, 2000). In regards to education, 71% of the treatment group completed grade 12 or higher in comparison to the 54% of the treatment group (Parks, 2000).The children who received the intervention were drastically better off in comparison to the control group. This demonstrated the effectiveness of an early education intervention and how its benefits are lifelong. 
<p class="indent">Another successful program that was implemented was PATHS which stands for Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies. PATHS was originally tested in 1999 by the Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, and they used 48 elementary schools across the country including schools in Nashville, Seattle, and Pennsylvania. There was a total of 6,715 kids across 378 classrooms. The control group received standard lessons provided by their teachers while the experimental group was taught by teachers who utilized the PATHS curriculum for that school year. The second study took place in 2004 and was testing the program in relation to special education students. There were 133 children in this study, 97 of them being male and 36 being female. The study was looking at the long-term effectiveness based on a randomized control study for kids who had learning disabilities, mental retardation, emotional and behavioral issues, physical disabilities, and handicaps (Program profile: Promoting alternative thinking strategies(Paths). 2011). Data was collected from the study for three subsequent years based on various social skills tests and behavioral lists. The final study for PATHS was complemented in 2007 and this was a randomized clinical trial. This study was implemented in two Head Start preschools in Pennsylvania. The study consisted of 246 children, 120 were boys and 126 were girls (Program profile: Promoting alternative thinking strategies(Paths). 2011). Similar to the previous studies the control group received the regular curriculum throughout the school year, while the children in the study received the PATHS curriculum. The results were measured using linear regression analysis specifically looking at the children's behavior, as well as social and emotional well-being. The theory behind PATHS is based on the ABCD model of development which stands for affective-behavioral-cognitive-dynamic (Program profile: Promoting alternative thinking strategies(Paths). 2011). The belief is that regulating behavior comes from emotional awareness and effective cognitive control and social functioning (Program profile: Promoting alternative thinking strategies(Paths). 2011). In turn, this will lead to less aggression and improved social interactions and self-control, which then will lead to a decrease in juvenile delinquency. The PATHS curriculum is intended for children from when they start school in PreK until grade 6. The newest implementation of the PATHS curriculum came out in 2011, which had a specific curriculum for each grade. The curriculum focuses on three major components which include self-control, feelings and relationships, and social problem solving (Program profile: Promoting alternative thinking strategies(Paths). 2011). The teachers who utilize this curriculum received training in a biweekly meeting from a consultant who explains the curriculum to them. The results of the three studies demonstrated statistically significant results in comparison to the control group in regards to aggression, disruptive behavior, and social skills (Program profile: Promoting alternative thinking strategies(Paths). 2011). A linear regression analysis examining the effects of the PATHS curriculum demonstrated a significant prevention effect on the child's inhibitory control such that children within the PATHS curriculum showed greater inhibitory control than their peers in the control group (Riggs et al., 2006). The children who received PATHS curriculum were able to problem solve in a calmer manner in contrast to the comparison group, who displayed more aggressive behaviors. By teaching a child how to control their aggression and providing improved social skills there will in turn be a reduction in juvenile delinquency.</p>
<p class="indent">Behavioral, Emotional, and Social Training: Competent Learners Achieving School Success which is represented by BEST in CLASS is an example of another successfully implemented early education developmental program. This is an intervention targeted at children ages 3-5 and is designed to prevent emotional and behavioral disorders in children who are high-risk. The main study took place from 2011 through 2015 within 4 school districts in two states. Teachers were randomly selected to implement the intervention while the control group was deemed the BAU (business as usual) group who continued their usual teaching curriculum and activities. Within the initial sample, there were 53 teachers selected to participate in the study: 26 participating in the program and 27 in the control group. The children who participated in the study were chosen based on being enrolled in a federal or state-funded school that had a selected teacher, being of elevated risk for an Emotional Behavioral Disorder (EBD), demonstrating problem behaviors, and having no indication of a cognitive developmental delay. The study looked at 130 preschool-aged children, with 66 participating in the intervention and 64 in the control group. There were three main elements of the intervention which consisted of the BEST in CLASS workshop, the BEST in CLASS Teacher Manual, and the BEST in CLASS practice-based coaching. The workshop consisted of a 6-hour long workshop on interactive and didactic learning activities, the teacher manual provided a basis for their lessons, and the practice-based coaching involved a coach spending two hours per week in the classroom alongside the teacher working to improve the implementation of the program. The intervention really focused on the interactions between the children and their teachers. The program was evaluated by “The Teacher-Child Interaction Direct Observation System Research Version 2.1” (Program profile: Behavioral, emotional, and social training: competent learners achieving school success(Best in class). 2018). This evaluated six elements including rules, precorrection, opportunity to respond, behavior-specific praise, instructive feedback, and corrective feedback. This evaluation was completed prior to the intervention and then once again when the intervention was completed to compare the conclusions. The study was repeated twice in 2018. The second study consisted of 185 teachers, with 92 of them being in the intervention group, and 462 children, with 230 in the intervention group. Similar to the first study an evaluation was done prior to the study and then once again when it finished to evaluate its effectiveness. This study was particularly focused on whether training and practice-based coaching were associated with teacher reports of child behavioral outcomes (Program profile: Behavioral, emotional, and social training: competent learners achieving school success(Best in class). 2018). The third study also conducted in 2018 was focused on the intervention's effectiveness on problematic behavior and the relationships/interactions between the children and their teachers, once again evaluating them prior to the intervention and then again after. This study also consisted of 185 teachers, with 92 of them being in the intervention, and 462 kids, with 231 in the intervention group. The theory behind this intervention is based on three main components which are behavioral, transactional, and ecological. The program was implemented with the driving thought that effective teacher-student relationships will have a positive effect on social interactions and behavioral responses as well as other spinoff benefits. The program was deemed effective based off of the three studies conducted. The major consistent findings of the programs included fewer disruptive, aggressive, and defiant behavior, fewer problematic behaviors, fewer negative interactions with teachers and other peers, lower levels of conflict in the classroom, and improved social interactions (Program profile: Behavioral, emotional, and social training: competent learners achieving school success(Best in class). 2018). Overall the children's behavior that was labeled as DAD, which stands for disruption, aggression, and defiance, decreased from a starting baseline of 9% to 2% at the end of the intervention (Conroy et al., 2014). This reflects a significant improvement in the children's behavior. By reducing problematic behavior and introducing social skills and cognitive coping, children are less at risk for juvenile delinquency and committing a crime in their future (Practice profile: Early self-control improvement programs for children. 2018). The program evaluation cited these results as statistically significant in comparison to the control group, demonstrating the effectiveness of the program (Program profile: Behavioral, emotional, and social training: competent learners achieving school success(Best in class). 2018). </p>
<p class="indent">The last program this paper will look into is School-Based Social and Emotional Learning (SEL). The program was designed to reduce an individual's problematic behavior and emotional stress. A review was written addressing the studies in relation to the program. A total of 213 studies were reviewed which included 270,034 children. The study occurred from 1990-2007 in various schools throughout Chicago, with these schools primarily located in an urban setting. This program is unique as it begins as an early intervention program targeting elementary school students, but then is continued through high school, so kids who participated in the study ranged from the ages of 5 through 18. The studies were randomized trials with a group that received the intervention and a control group. These participants were followed up with as they aged until they aged out of the program. SEL is based on two educational approaches, the first targeting social and emotional skills, the second aiming to provide a safe environment to let these skills build. The five main elements of SEL are self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making. SEL has been deemed effective in reducing juvenile delinquency and effective in improving mental health. Based on 112 of the studies conducted there was a 22% decrease in conduct problems for those who participated in the program in comparison to the control group (Practice profile: School-based social and emotional learning (Sel) programs. 2015). Forty nine studies demonstrated a 24% decrease in emotional stress for those in the intervention in comparison to those in the control group (Practice profile: School-based social and emotional learning (Sel) programs. 2015). These are statistically significant differences demonstrating the effect of SEL and its implementation. All four of these early education programs have proven effective in reducing the likelihood of the child getting involved in delinquent behavior. These programs target risk factors and combat them by providing social skills and behavioral training, while also providing an emphasis on education. </p>
<p class="indent">Overall, all of these programs were deemed effective and have shown a reduction in potential delinquent behavior in juveniles. Recent research has shown that about 12%-25% of children display some type of significant behavioral issues (Conroy et al., 2014). By addressing key risk factors at a young age including aggressive behavior, antisocial tendencies, low self-control, and poor social skills and replacing them with improved self-control, less aggression, and improved cognitive development and social skills, these kids have a better chance of a successful future (de Vries, S. L. A., et al., 2018). Programs focused on self-control, which is the center of many problematic behaviors, have shown a reduction rate in delinquency by 27% and an overall improvement in self-control of 32% (Piquero et al., 2016). These are significant results and they are only highlighting one element of these early education programs. Interventions that take place in an educational setting have the extra impact of not only reducing these problematic behaviors, but by encouraging and supporting academic success which will open future doors for these children. In each program, there was a significant statistical difference between the group that received the intervention and the control group. </p> 
    <p><span class="bolded">Limitations of Developmental Crime Prevention</span></p>
<p class="indent">There is nothing that comes without its challenges and developmental crime prevention has a few challenges of its own that it is working to overcome. The three main limitations associated with developmental crime prevention are finding the start-up funds, the time delay between the implementation of the program and being able to see results if any, and the overall ethics of implementing early interventions. To begin an intervention program one needs the funds to get the program up and running, which can be quite expensive. Looking at an early education program and all the elements that go into the program including the curriculum, the educating of instructors, and researchers who are working alongside the teachers are just a few examples. All of these individuals need to be trained, which costs money, and then compensated for their efforts. Individuals, specifically politicians, are hesitant to give money to these potential programs as there is a possibility they will end up ineffective, and now politicians have “wasted” all of this time, energy, and money on an ineffective program. Politicians may also be hesitant to give funds to these types of programs due to their constituents potentially viewing it as supporting “soft on crime” policies, which in turn would result in the politician losing support. Given these high financial and political costs, it is incredibly difficult to find the start-up money for an intervention. Another challenge is that there is often a large time delay between the implementation of the program and actually being able to tell if it has had an impact. Specifically, developmental crime prevention programs tend to be longitudinal studies as researchers are studying how the intervention affects the child now and in their future life. This drives many away from implementing these programs as they do not want to wait for results, especially when they may spend all this time studying an intervention that turns out to be ineffective. Perry Preschool is a prominent example of an effective developmental crime prevention program but this study was evaluated over the course of years. Participants received the intervention when they were three and four, and are continued to be followed up on at age fifty. This deters many from beginning such an intervention and also takes away support from such programs, as people would rather support something they can see immediate satisfaction from. Ethics is also often brought up in regards to early education interventions. There is no guarantee that an intervention will be successful and there is a very real possibility it will be ineffective and that runs a risk of being potentially harmful. Although this is unlikely, many question whether or not this is a risk we should be taking. There can be a justified explanation as to why the intervention was ineffective, but it is much harder to reason how the participants were worse off after receiving the intervention (Gatti, 1998). This also once again brings light to the concern that it takes a while to see how negative these results actually are in terms of the participants (Gatti, 1998). This is a ongoing debate that will continue to be one of the main challenges that developmental crime prevention faces, specifically in relation to early education interventions. </p>
<p class="indent">Although there are limitations to developmental crime prevention, there are certainly ways that these limitations can be overcome. It is statistically proven that the majority of citizens would rather support prevention programs, including childhood prevention programs, than punitive responses (Welsh, B.C., Farrington, D.P. 2014). This needs to be directed at government officials so they can reallocate funding that goes to the criminal justice system, and give more money to preventative programs. If money is shifted researchers would have a much easier time getting the resources they need to start up the program they are working on. In regards to the lengthy time delay between the implementation of the intervention and seeing desired results, researchers should focus less on the long term results and more on short term changes. Often, short-term changes are incredibly strong indicators of the desired results. After a few years of an intervention being implemented, it is going to become quite clear if it is presenting as effective or if it is not achieving its desired goal. Although there is no way to get around a time investment, researchers can determine whether or not it is worth it to continue researching. In response to ethical concerns, once again there is no way to guarantee that there will be no harmful effects. Although there has been research done showing that when interventions are focused on promoting good social skills and self control there is a much better chance of it being effective and subsequently reducing juvenile delinquency as a benefit (Gatti, 1998). Rather than targeting behavior that is believed to be an indication of delinquency, interventions emphasizing overall social skills and self control will then reduce the likelihood of delinquent behavior (Gatti, 1998). These learned behaviors then give the child the skills they need to be successful in the future and steer them away from criminal behavior. Researchers also study the intervention prior to its implementation and investigate potential risks and various different outcomes. They then determine whether or not the intervention has a chance of being successful and if it is worth implementing. </p>
