    <p class="indent">I decided to alter my adventure report into a twine game. I decided to do this as my adventure report involved a lot of choices being made throughout the story, and I thought it could be fun to allow the player of this game to make their own choices, leading them to have their own adventure in NYC. I followed the outline of my own story from the adventure report but gave various options for the player of the game. If the player selected an option that followed my story and the choices I made I often included something along the lines of “Great choice!” or “That's the choice I would pick” so throughout the game my own story is still present. The audience for my adventure report was more limited in the sense that it was only shared with certain people. The platform I used to write the piece was google docs, and then I uploaded it to canvas as it was a class assignment. Although it was a fun, light-hearted story, which I wrote heavily in a storytelling manner, it is still in the context of academic writing as I was aware going into the piece I am writing this paper for a class assignment. For the twine game I created, I think that the audience is much wider as it is published on a much larger platform, where in theory anyone can play it. It changes the context of the piece from “my story” to “your story”. I think it allowed me to explore a more creative side of myself that I do not normally get to do. Prior to this assignment, my only knowledge of twine was the introduction we had to it in class. After the class assignment on twine, I found it to be a really interesting platform and began to play around with other twines, as well as explore the twine itself. This was my first official game on twine and I enjoyed creating it. At times I would get frustrated if I did not remember how to do things, but everything was relatively easy to look up online and I was able to play around with it until I could figure it out. I think that turning the particular adventure story I wrote, about friends taking an impulsive trip to NYC, really worked as a twine game. I was able to incorporate my storyline, but I also was able to expand the story and create other options about fun things to do in NY. I was able to incorporate things I had done on previous trips to the city and create them as options. There were also times within the game I limited the player's options, specifically toward the end. I did this to create a sort of alternate ending for the game, so even though the player does not get to specifically choose what activity they do, they made the choice to do that activity which leads to the end of the game. My original work is also published on this website under Adventure Report, so read that first and then check out the game!</p>
