    <p>The 9-5 of a 10 year old Golden Retriever</p>
        
    <p>Everyone thinks that during the day dogs wait by the door and await their owners coming home. Now part of this is true but there are many things I do throughout the day that my family doesn't know about. Being a dog is a full-time job, in fact, one of the most important and challenging jobs there can be. I'm home alone from 8:30 in the morning until 5:30 at night, I technically work more than the average person. During this time I have to complete all my daily tasks, without using the bathroom or eating. No one understands how hard a dog's day can be so I am going to share a typical workday with you.
    My morning starts when my mom comes down the stairs and interrupts my beauty sleep. It takes me a few minutes to get up and start my day. Mom keeps talking about how I'm getting old and it's taking me longer to do things. 1. This is offensive as I am a fine age of 70. 2. I take a long time to get up because I am mad that my dream was interrupted. I have the most exciting dreams about toys, food, and of course chasing squirrels. After I get up I go outside and do a general surveillance take. I see if anyone else is out at this hour and I noticed the cars on my street. Protecting my house is always my number one job. Then my mom leaves and gives me a kiss goodbye, and this is where the real fun begins. 
    As soon as my mom leaves I begin my 1st assignment of the day. I go take out all my toys. Mom is always putting away my toys yelling at me that she's stepping on them. I think this is her fault as she really needs to pay attention to where she's walking. After scattering my toys throughout the house it is time to complete my 2nd task: make sure the couch is still comfortable. 
    Mom is barely home enough to ensure that the couch is still functioning and comfortable. I've taken this tremendous responsibility upon myself. I jump up on the couch and lie down daily to ensure it's still in working order. I then proceed to take a nap to test its sleep ability. It is very important to have a couch that someone can sleep on. Dad always use to have to sleep on the couch so this test is incredibly important. I then drift off to dream.
    By the time I wake up, I can sense the mailman approaching. Whenever mom is home she always yells at me to not bark at the mailman and that he's just doing his job. This always confuses me because I know it's the mailman doing his job. I jump up to the window and I can see that it's him (sometimes I wonder if she thinks Im stupid). I don't bark to scare him away I bark because I know he has a treat him. One time we were outside when the mailman came and he came over to me and gave me a treat. I bark to get his attention so he can give me a treat. This is a tireless task as he never once opens the door to give me a treat.  
    After this disappointment, I go to find some of her socks and then snuggle with them to remind me of her and keep her close to me. Mom always use to yell at me for taking her socks but now she knows it's just because I miss her. I snuggle up with her socks and await her arrival. This has got to be the hardest job I do all day: wait. I can never tell how much time has passed or what time it is all I know is when I jump up to the window and can no longer see out, she has to be on her way soon. The absolute highlight of my day is when I hear that door nob turn. I jump up and grab her socks and a toy to greet her with at the door. 
    Being a dog is one of the hardest jobs that there is. I mean we are left in charge of a whole house for multiple hours a day, starting when we are just kids! Nevertheless, I do my job each and every day to the best of my ability and I have to say it is one of the best jobs there is. The only downside to being a dog, I never get any money. One time I chewed up a 20-dollar bill, which I rightly deserved, and I don't think I've ever seen mom that mad. Needless to say, I never did that again. But anyways I got sidetracked, being a dog is great and I would not trade my job for anything else in the world.
