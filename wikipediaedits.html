    <p> My Thoughts on Editing Wikipedia! </p> 
        
   <p class="indent">Working with Wikipedia was a new experience for me, and it was something that was not necessarily in my comfort zone. Before making my first edit, I was very nervous that my edit would be incorrect in some way. After going back and forth with myself for a while, I was finally able to make my initial edit which was simply adding a comma. After doing this and seeing that nothing truly terrible happened it gave me much more confidence and comfort in my own Wikipedia abilities. I think the best way for Wikipedia to get more editors is to simply let people know that they can edit Wikipedia. I always knew that Wikipedia was open to the public for edits, but for some reason, I never felt like the ability to edit applied to me. I just assumed that the editors of Wikipedia were of a higher standard than me and I was in no position to contribute or edit. I think informing people that they can be an editor of Wikipedia without any special requirements would present an invitation for people to become editors. I also think that it needs to be communicated that it's okay to make a mistake on Wikipedia, and the fear of making a mistake on Wikipedia, should not hold you back from making an edit. The community of Wikipedia is something I did not understand until I began editing. If you happen to make a mistake there is a very good chance that someone will catch that mistake and correct it for you. Wikipedia also provides the talk button which allows you to communicate with other editors that are interested in the same things as you, so if you ever need someone to read over wants you would like to contribute that is a good option. I think that everyone can be a contributor to Wikipedia, and this can create great online communities for individuals. </p>
